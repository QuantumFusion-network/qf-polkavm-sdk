# QF PolkaVM SDK

This framework allows to implement contracts for Quantum Fusion Network.

## Run examples

To run examples or other smart contracts first need to have install [qf-solochain](https://github.com/QuantumFusion-network/qf-solochain) or via [portal](http://portal.qfnetwork.xyz/).

## Executables and runtimes

This section describes the project's executables and runtimes and provides step-by-step instructions
 for running a local testnet. This guide is suitable for advanced users.
See [docs/executables_and_runtimes.md](docs/executables_and_runtimes.md).

## Compiling Smart Contracts for PolkaVM

Please read section [Compiling Smart Contracts for PolkaVM](https://github.com/QuantumFusion-network/qf-solochain/blob/main/README.md).
